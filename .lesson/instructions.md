# Instructions  

Write a class named TestScores. The class constructor should accept an array of test scores as its argument. The class should have a method that returns the average of the test scores. If any test score in the array is negative or greater than 100, the class should throw an exception. Write an exception class named InvalidTestScores. The TestScores class should throw an InvalidTestScores exception if any of the test scores in the array are invalid.
